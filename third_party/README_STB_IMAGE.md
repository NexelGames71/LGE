# stb_image.h Required

To use custom icon images, you need to add `stb_image.h` to the `third_party` directory.

Download it from: https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h

Place the file at: `third_party/stb_image.h`

This single-header library is used to load PNG and JPG image files for the custom icons.
